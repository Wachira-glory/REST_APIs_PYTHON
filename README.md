The School Management System is a web app built with Django to help schools manage their activities more easily. It handles important tasks like managing courses, scheduling classes, enrolling students, assigning teachers, and allocating classrooms. Administrators can use it to set up and update courses, plan class schedules, and keep track of student progress. The system also helps assign teachers to the right classes and make sure classrooms are used efficiently. Its user-friendly design offers secure logins for administrators, teachers, and students, making it a useful tool for running a school smoothly.
